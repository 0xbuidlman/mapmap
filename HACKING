Coding style
============

* indent with 2 spaces
* opening curly braces on a new line
* function and method names camelCase, with lowercase first letter
* class names CamelCase
* private data members with an underscore as a prefix: _likeThis
* file names all lowercase
* always add spaces between operators such as +, -, /, * casts, etc. (except pointers and references)
* MapperGLCanvas has a strange name considering we also have a Mapper class; actually I'm thinking we should rename Mapper to MappingView or something (since a Mapper is actually the View of the Mapping class)
* Override includesPoint() in Mesh
