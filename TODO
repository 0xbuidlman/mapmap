To do in MapMap
===============

Code
----

* MapperGLCanvas has a strange name considering we also have a Mapper class; actually I'm thinking we should rename Mapper to MappingView or something (since a Mapper is actually the View of the Mapping class)
* DONE Override includesPoint() in Mesh
* video gstreamer

Packaging
---------
* delete old branches
* update doc
* does translation work?
* Instructions build Mac OS X?
